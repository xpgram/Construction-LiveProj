SiteAdministrator (But probably all views):

- Send button in chat dialog is misaligned with text-entry box



Details View on Scheduled Job Item

- Why aren't we listing assigned employees? Employees *are* listed in the schedule docket, but not in the details view.

- Jobs have a notes field, but:

  - It doesn't seem condusive to more than 1 note

    - In docket view nor in details view, there's very little space

  - There is no description box, and notes appears not to serve that function anyway.

    - It's easy to see where a job will be and who is assigned to it
    - It is not easy to see what that job is actually for
      - Which might be nice to have if even just for clerical reasons.

  - I would assign a list of notes, each being their own string.

    - Like what I did for budgetboy/passwordboy
